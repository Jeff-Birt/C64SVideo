## Mk3 SVideo cable for the C64/C128

The Mk1 version was simple a low quality SVideo cable and stereo audio cable soldered to an 8-pin DIN plug. This was usable but had shortcomings, notably lack of a 330ohm resistor for the chroma signal and the whine from the SID audio input.

The Mk2 version was done in a hurray to overcome the annoying whine of the SID's audio input picking up noise. Though it was supposed to be a temporary solution it lasted a few years with a lot of patching back together.

The Mk3 cable was made with mostly things I had on hand and using the proper type of shielded cables. While a bit fiddly to build because of the tiny VGA cable wires it works very well. I milled out the PCB I used (C64_SVideo_Cable_Milled_2021-02-28.zip) but also created a version that can be professionally made by PCBWay, etc. (C64_SVideo_Cable_Pro_2021-03-17.zip). I have not had any of these PCBs made but they should be OK.
